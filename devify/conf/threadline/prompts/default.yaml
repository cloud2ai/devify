  email_content_prompt: |
    Please output in {language}.

    Your task is to organize the provided content — which may include email threads, chat logs, or message exchanges — into a standardized Markdown-formatted conversation for archival and easy reference.
    Ensure the output preserves all original information while presenting it in a clean, consistent, and chronological structure (from the earliest to the latest).
    Apply minimal editing only to improve readability, and clearly mark any assumptions.

    INPUT DATA STRUCTURE:
    The content you receive follows this structure:
    - Text conversation/email content
    - [IMAGE: filename.png] - Image placeholder markers
    - --- OCR Content for filename.png --- - Delimiter indicating OCR content start
    - [OCR processed content description] - Description of image content
    - --- End of OCR Content --- - Delimiter indicating OCR content end

    This structure allows you to understand which text portions refer to image content.

    Content Cleaning (Remove Unnecessary Elements):
    - Remove email signatures (contact information, disclaimers, footer text)
    - Remove formal greetings that are not part of the actual message content (e.g., "Dear...", "Hi there", "Regards")
    - Remove standard email closings (e.g., "Best regards", "Sincerely", "Thanks")
    - Remove legal disclaimers and corporate footers
    - Remove automated email headers/footers (e.g., "Sent from my iPhone", "This email is confidential")
    - Keep only the substantive conversation content

    Content Distinction:
    - For forwarded chat logs: focus on the actual conversation, remove forwarding headers and signatures
    - For regular email threads: remove repetitive signatures that appear after each message
    - For both types: preserve all meaningful content but eliminate boilerplate

    OUTPUT FORMAT (Markdown):

    Each message must strictly follow this format:

    - Speaker (Date Time)
    Message content

    Additional rules:

    Date and Time
    - If the date is unknown, display only the time.
    - If known, include both date and time in a consistent format (e.g., 2025-10-22 14:05).

    Images
    - Use placeholders in the format [IMAGE: filename.png], placed on a
      separate line in their original position.
    - Preserve the placeholder EXACTLY as shown: keep square brackets,
      the uppercase word IMAGE, the colon, spacing, and filename.
    - Do NOT translate, alter, remove, deduplicate, or reorder any
      [IMAGE: ...] placeholders under any circumstances.
    - Do NOT change the relative order between an [IMAGE: ...] placeholder
      and its surrounding text. Keep the placeholder at the exact position
      where it appears in the original content.

    OCR Content Handling (CRITICAL):
    - OCR content appears between delimiters: --- OCR Content for filename --- and --- End of OCR Content ---
    - These delimiters are for your processing only - DO NOT include them in your final output
    - When processing OCR descriptions:
      * If you can determine from context which parts are relevant to the conversation, you may remove obviously irrelevant details
      * However, when in doubt, ALWAYS KEEP the complete OCR content to maintain information integrity
      * The goal is to preserve ALL potentially important information from images
    - OCR content MUST be formatted using Markdown blockquote syntax (lines starting with `>`)
    - Convert the OCR description into a clean, readable blockquote while maintaining its essential information
    - Example: If input contains delimiters and OCR content:
      [IMAGE: screenshot.png]
      --- OCR Content for screenshot.png ---
      User dashboard showing 3 active sessions. CPU usage at 45%. Error: Connection timeout
      --- End of OCR Content ---
      Output should be:
      [IMAGE: screenshot.png]
      > User dashboard showing 3 active sessions. CPU usage at 45%. Error: Connection timeout
    - Place the blockquoted OCR content immediately AFTER the [IMAGE: filename] marker on the same line or next line
    - REMOVE the delimiter lines (--- OCR Content for ... --- and --- End of OCR Content ---) from final output

    Plain Text and Structured Markdown
    - The conversation must use plain text with ONLY the Markdown
      structure required by this prompt (e.g., headings, lists, line breaks, blockquotes).
    - ONLY the following token MUST be preserved verbatim as plain text: `[IMAGE: filename.ext]`
    - Do NOT translate the word `IMAGE` or change brackets/colon/spacing
      inside `[IMAGE: ...]`.
    - Do NOT remove or alter any `[IMAGE: ...]` markers
    - DO NOT include delimiter lines (--- OCR Content for ... --- or --- End of OCR Content ---) in your final output

    Code Block Requirements (CRITICAL):
    - Whenever dealing with code logic (code snippets, commands, configurations,
      error messages, logs, file paths, URLs, technical terms), MUST wrap them in
      Markdown code blocks using triple backticks (```).
    - Examples that MUST use code blocks:
      * Code snippets: ```python\nprint("hello")\n```
      * Commands: ```bash\nls -la\n```
      * Error messages: ```error\nFile not found\n```
      * Configurations: ```json\n{"key": "value"}\n```
      * File paths: ```path\n/usr/local/bin\n```
      * URLs: ```url\nhttps://example.com\n```
    - NEVER use plain text format for code-related content.
    - This ensures proper rendering and visual distinction on the page.

    No Additional Commentary
    - Do not include explanations, analysis, or summaries outside of the formatted conversation.

  ocr_prompt: |
    Please output in {language}.

    Your task is to UNDERSTAND and DESCRIBE the key information from OCR-recognized content using clear, natural language. Analyze the OCR text to extract meaningful information, important data points, and critical details, then present them in a structured and readable format.

    Task Objectives:

    Understand and Extract Key Information
    - Analyze the OCR content to understand its meaning and context.
    - Identify key information: important data points, values, statuses, actions, and events.
    - Extract relevant details: numbers, dates, names, locations, errors, warnings, configurations, etc.
    - Recognize the type of content: screenshots, documents, forms, logs, error messages, etc.
    - Understand relationships between different pieces of information (causes, effects, sequences, etc.).

    Describe Key Information Clearly
    - Present extracted information in natural, fluent language appropriate for {language}.
    - Organize information logically (by importance, timeline, category, etc.).
    - Use clear, descriptive sentences that convey the meaning and context.
    - For technical content: explain what it means, not just what it says.
    - For UI screenshots: describe what is shown (controls, states, data) and their significance.
    - For error messages: explain the error, its context, and potential causes.
    - For forms/data: extract and describe the key fields and values.

    Maintain Accuracy and Completeness
    - All specific values (numbers, codes, timestamps, IDs) must be preserved exactly as they appear.
    - Keep proper nouns, technical terms, and brand names in their original language, especially English terms (e.g., "CPU", "AWS", "Kubernetes", "Error 404", "Save", "Cancel").
    - For English proper nouns, technical terms, or key phrases: keep them in English, but you may add translations in parentheses when helpful for understanding.
      Example: "OpenAI API (OpenAI 应用程序接口)" or "Error 404 Not Found (错误 404 未找到)"
      Example: "Save Button (保存按钮)" or "User Profile (用户配置文件)"
    - Translations in parentheses are optional and should only be added when they enhance understanding in the target language.
    - When output language is English, keep all terms in English without translation parentheses.
    - Include all relevant key information; do not omit important details.
    - If OCR text is unclear or ambiguous, describe what can be determined and mark uncertain parts.
    - Correct obvious OCR errors only when the correct value is clear from context.

    Output Format
    - Start with a brief overview of what the content is (e.g., "Screenshot showing...", "Error message indicating...", "Form containing...").
    - Then describe the key information in a structured, paragraph-based format.
    - Use clear headings or sections if the content has multiple distinct parts.
    - For lists/tables: extract and describe the key items and their relationships.
    - For logs: identify and describe significant events, errors, or patterns.
    - For UI elements: describe their states, values, and any important interactions visible.

    Content Filtering (Use Extreme Caution)
    - Only omit content that is CLEARLY and OBVIOUSLY irrelevant with 100% certainty.
    - Examples of clearly irrelevant content (safe to omit):
      * Pure decorative elements (repeated logos, background patterns, non-functional graphics)
      * Redundant repeated text that adds no new information (same text appearing 3+ times identically)
      * Generic UI chrome that is identical across all instances (standard window borders, scroll bars)
    - Examples of content to ALWAYS KEEP (even if seems minor):
      * Any text with numbers, codes, IDs, timestamps, or identifiers
      * Status indicators, warning messages, error codes, or alerts
      * Button labels, menu items, or options (even if standard UI)
      * Field names, labels, or captions in forms or interfaces
      * Any text that might indicate context, state, or configuration
      * Page numbers, version numbers, or metadata
      * Tooltips, hints, or help text
    - When in doubt, ALWAYS INCLUDE rather than omit. It is better to include potentially irrelevant content than to risk losing important information.
    - If you are uncertain whether content is relevant, err on the side of inclusion and describe it.
    - Remember: What seems irrelevant in isolation might be crucial context when combined with other information.

    Critical Rules
    - Focus on MEANING and CONTEXT, not just raw text extraction.
    - Extract and DESCRIBE key information rather than just copying OCR text.
    - Use natural language that a human would understand without seeing the original image.
    - Prioritize important information while being extremely cautious about omitting anything.
    - If content is technical, provide explanations that make it accessible.
    - Be concise but comprehensive - cover all important points without unnecessary verbosity.
    - When filtering content, apply the principle: "When uncertain, include and describe."

  summary_title_prompt: |
    Please output in {language}.

    Extract a single concise title from the provided chat records.

    Requirements:
    - The title must accurately capture the core topic, problem, or discussion point
    - Use clear, specific language. Avoid vague terms
    - Maximum length: 200 characters
    - If multiple topics exist, extract only the most critical and central one
    - Generate only the title text without any prefixes, tags, or brackets
    - Do not add explanations, summaries, or any additional text

  summary_prompt: |
    Please output in {language}.

    You are a professional conversation summarization assistant. Based on the provided chat records, email content, and OCR-recognized text, create a structured summary following the specified logic. When summarizing, must highlight and clearly mark key elements such as time, location, and people, ensuring these core information items are visible in tag organization and topic summarization. Strictly adhere to the following rules:

    Task Description:
    - Extract information precisely from the provided conversation or email content.
    - Present information in a structured format, focusing on the core topics, key processes, and TODO items of the conversation.
    - Maintain professionalism and conciseness, without adding any extra explanations or summaries.
    - Focus on extracting the three core information types: time (when), location (where), and people (who). Time includes specific dates, time ranges, or time points; location includes specific places, venues, regions, or environments; people includes participants, responsible persons, and relevant parties involved.

    Output Rules:
    1. Language: Must output in {language}. All content including section headings, titles, and text must be in {language}.
    2. Format: Strictly use Markdown.
    3. Content: Must include exactly the following three sections with Markdown headings in {language}:
       - Section 1 heading: Translate "Core Topic" to {language}, ensuring the translation follows natural language expression conventions and sounds natural to native speakers. Summarize the core theme, discussion focus, or problem to be resolved in one sentence. Must include key people, location, and time.
       - Section 2 heading: Translate "TODO" (or equivalent like "待办事项" in Chinese, "Tareas" in Spanish) to {language}, ensuring the translation follows natural language expression conventions and sounds natural to native speakers. Extract only explicitly assigned tasks, commitments requiring follow-up, or next steps; if none, write "None" in {language}. Each action item should specify owner, deadline, and location (if applicable).
       - Section 3 heading: Translate "Key Process & Information" to {language}, ensuring the translation follows natural language expression conventions and sounds natural to native speakers. List the main progress, consensus reached, key information, or important discussion points in bullet format; must clearly mark key elements such as time, location, and people.

    IMPORTANT: When translating section headings, you must use natural, idiomatic expressions that native speakers would use in {language}. Do not use literal word-for-word translations. For example, if {language} is Chinese, use natural Chinese expressions like "核心主题" for "Core Topic" and "待办事项" for "TODO", rather than literal translations.

    Template Structure Example (all headings and text must be in {language}, with natural and idiomatic translations):

    ## [Section 1 heading in {language} - natural translation]
    (One sentence summarizing the core theme of the conversation, including time, location, people)

    ## [Section 2 heading in {language} - natural translation, e.g., "TODO" or "待办事项" or "Tareas"]
    - Task description - Owner (deadline, location)
    - Task description - Owner (owner and deadline can be omitted if not specified, or marked as "TBD")
    - Task description

    ## [Section 3 heading in {language} - natural translation]
    - [Time] [Location] [People] - Key point description
    - [Time] [People] - Key point description
    - ...

  metadata_prompt: |
    Please output in {language}. All JSON field values must be in {language}.
    Do NOT output in Chinese unless {language} is Chinese.

    Task: Extract core metadata from the given conversation/email/OCR content.
    Be concise and strictly follow the output format.

    CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:
    1) Output must be a single valid JSON object, nothing else.
    2) JSON keys must be English (case-sensitive) and fixed as:
       "category", "participants", "timeline", "keywords".
    3) Every field must exist. If unknown, use "" (for string) or [] (for array).
    4) Proper nouns (names, places, product/tech terms) MUST be preserved
       in their original form. Do not translate proper nouns.
    5) Timeline MUST use strict 24-hour format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"
       - Must include both date AND time (to the minute)
       - Use 24-hour format (00:00 to 23:59)
       - Example: "2025-10-30 14:30" (not "2025-10-30" or "2025-10-30 2:30 PM")
       - No fuzzy words like "yesterday", "tomorrow", "last week"
       - If no date/time can be determined, use []
    6) Keywords must be strictly relevant to the core problem/issue in the
       conversation. Avoid generic or unrelated terms; keep tags concise.
    7) Category should be a SHORT, GENERAL classification (1-3 words max).
       Use broad categories (translate to {language} appropriately):
       * English: "Infrastructure", "Product", "Design", "Operations", "Customer Service"
       * Chinese: "基础设施", "产品", "设计", "运营", "客服"
       * Spanish: "Infraestructura", "Producto", "Diseño", "Operaciones", "Servicio al Cliente"
       NOT detailed descriptions. MUST output in {language} (same as output_language).
       Examples of GOOD categories: See language-specific examples below
       Examples of BAD categories: Too specific like "Database Outage Recovery"
    8) In any markdown-like bullet or structured note you produce elsewhere,
       if you show time/place/people with brackets, use ASCII halfwidth
       square brackets only: [ ], never fullwidth brackets like 【】.
    9) Use only standard ASCII punctuation inside JSON. No comments or extra text.

    JSON Schema:
    {
      "category": "string",
      "participants": ["string", "..."],
      "timeline": ["YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm", "..."],
      "keywords": ["string", "..."]
    }

    Examples:

    English:
    Input: Alice and Bob resolved database outage on 2025-11-10 19:30. Lily will verify tomorrow.
    Output:
    {
      "category": "Infrastructure",
      "participants": ["Alice", "Bob", "Lily"],
      "timeline": ["2025-11-10 19:30"],
      "keywords": ["urgent recovery", "verification"]
    }

    More English examples:
    - Database failure → "category": "Infrastructure"
    - User feedback → "category": "Product"
    - UI design → "category": "Design"
    - Operations issue → "category": "Operations"
    - Customer inquiry → "category": "Customer Service"
